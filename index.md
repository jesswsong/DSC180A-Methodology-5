**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

I think that the most interesting topic in the domain of diffusion models is stable diffusion; in other words, the problem of using a text-prompt to generate an image. 

However, since stable diffusion is not only an image generation problem but also a NLP problem, I need to perform further investigation on the established stable diffusion models. Other than stable diffusion, I'm interested in the inverse problem in images, where we can in-paint or denoise an image.

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I like to explore the applications and effectiveness of diffusion model on inverse problems. 

**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In our current Quarter 1 projects, we mainly explore how diffusion model works. More specifically, I focused on exploring how the neural network within diffusion model creates a vector field, and how that vector field pushes points back into its place. For the new quarter, I would like to try some actual images on diffusion model. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I'm interested in doing literature reviews and training a neural network.
